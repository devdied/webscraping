# Web Scraping
In this project, I scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. In part 2 of this project, I scrape and analyze Mars weather data using pandas and matplotlib, which exist in a table. The data is finally saved to mar_data.csv.
